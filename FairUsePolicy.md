### Rules 

1\. Delta and snapshot calls are supported in `/fixtures`, `/fixtures/special` , `/odds` and `/odds/special`  endpoints.  Delta calls return changes since the provided  `since` value. For delta calls `since` parameter must not be set to 0 or 1, it must be always set with the `last` property value of the previous call response. Snapshot calls return the current state,  `since` parameter must not be provided for snapshot calls.

2\. Always first issue a snapshot call and continue with the delta calls. This would result in a faster response time and a smaller response payload. As a result, the client will   get the odds/fixtures updates faster.

3\. Client must not call `/odds` or `/fixture` endpoint for each sport league or fixture in the loop.  If the client is interested in certain leagues only,  `leagueIds` parameter must be set with all the league identifiers. 
 Same for the `eventIds` parameter, the client should use it only if interested in specific events in which case all event identifiers must be provided in the same call.

4\. The following limitations must be observed for `/sports` call:

- Requests made for the `/sports`  must be restricted to once every 60 seconds. List of sports does not change often. The count of active events is obsolete functionality, that will eventually be decommissioned.

5\. The following limitations must be observed per sport:

- Snapshot call to `/fixtures` and `/odds` endpoints must be restricted to once every 60 seconds, regardless of the `leagueIds`, `eventIds` or `islive` parameters.

- Delta calls to  `/fixtures` and `/odds` endpoints must be restricted to once every 5 seconds, regardless of the `leagueIds`, `eventIds` or `islive` parameters.       

- Calls to `/leagues` must be restricted to once every 60 seconds.

6\. Client must not call `/line` endpoint in the loop. The purpose of this endpoint is to check the price prior to the bet placing.

### The following limitations must be observed per sport:

- Requests made for the /fixtures and /odds operation without the since parameter must be restricted to once every 60 seconds;
- Requests made for the /fixtures and /odds operation with the since parameter must be restricted to once every 5 seconds.
